Some questions posed in class by students were hard to hear online. A good practice is for the lecturer to summarily repeat the question of the student (since the lecturer is heard clearly online) before answering the question.,"interaction, impediments, noise, in-class",hybrid-specific
"In person students might be slightly confused with online interaction, as passing from in person interaction to online (still in classroom, e.g. when Jari is speaking) might feel weird and distracting. Same for teaching: It is hard to teach to an in-person class, as it is easier to focus on a video than on real people. If many people are in person, the opposite occurs (the online students are distracting and “forgotten”). The half-half mix of in-person/online is hard to manage.","interaction, in-class, online",hybrid-specific
"Online students sometimes wanted to intervene, but were not able to get their spotlight in time (e.g., the question was asked also in person, and in person got higher priority, e.g. due to spontaneous not-moderated follow-up question etc.). Higher priority is given to in-person due to the more “syncronous” way of getting the word. An inherent problem causing this is the time required to give the word to online students and voice out interesting chat comments. ","interaction, timing, online",interaction
"Even if the “respondent student” was in class, and the “asking” student online, the “respondent student” preferred to answer the question directly online.","interaction, in-person, online, chat","hybrid-specific, interaction"
"Lecturers in some cases did not give enough time/attention to online, i.e., did not spontaneously stop to ask “questions online?”, leaving online students unheard. ","interaction, timing, online",interaction
"Unrelated questions (e.g., general questions regarding the assignment during student project presentations), were asked online, showcasing an “asynchronous” nature of the online chat","interaction, online, chat",interaction
"Lecturers in some cases did not give enough time/attention to online, i.e., did not spontaneously and recurrently stop to ask “questions online?”, leaving online students unheard. ","interaction, in-class, online, timing",interaction
"Online questions are generally better posed, and often include a rather long preamble to provide context to the question

"“Harder” questions posed by the lecturer take more time to think about, and provide the online students more time to pose the question online ","interaction, online, timing",interaction
Online students with camera on often switched camera on and off multiple times during the lectures. Other students walked away from the camera for a short while and then came back.,"webcam, frequency",cameras
"Seldomly, some students connected with their camera on by mistake, and immediately turned that off (camera was set as on by default, and had to be opted-out before login).","webcam, involuntary",cameras
"Most of the students with cameras on turned them off while the lecture was going on (the later in the lecture, the less people with cameras on)","webcam, frequency, decrease",cameras

Online students accessing class from a room with other housemates in it seldomly get distracted and quickly exchange few sentences with their roomates,focus,online
"Raising hands to quickly count opinions e.g., students who agree with a statement or not, is much more effective in-person","timing, online, interaction",interaction
"A student had to access a tutoring session from one of the VU computer rooms. She was not distracted but might have distracted other students by talking in the shared room.
Approaching the end of the session, she was kicked out of her spot because another student wanted to sit and the call abruptly ended.","focus, fairness",online
"Menti open questions do not get a much lower response rate (e.g., 32/33 in the DS lecture of the 20/9) but take more time to get answered to","menti, questions",menti
"The fun of gamification was in some cases confirm by busters of laughter (e.g., if a student answered was always the first to provide the correct answer, or if most of the class failed to provide the correct answer)","menti, success",menti

"As online interaction is much harder, lecturers should try to give higher priority to the few online interactions. Potentially open by answering online questions first, rather than the opposite. Ensuring to show that online interactions are relevant empowers students to ask further questions and interact online",memo,memo
"Interaction with online students should be stimulated (e.g., by opening first ot the online questions to empower students to feel present in the lecture end enforce their relevance within the lecure interaction, use menti quizzes, asking if anyone online has questions, etc.)",memo,memo
"Social/economic fairness might be hindered for online students, as online students need an individual room and  laptop. Having a shared room with other housemates might distract students. ",memo,memo
"Students online might be reticent to answer questions, as their answers are “hardcoded” black in white, and are hard to be reformulated, corrected with ease without taking the word.",memo,memo
"Gamificated questions (Menti) get higher response rate, and engage more online students",memo,memo
"Online provides freedom, but comes with the catch of having to ensure students learn",memo,memo
