"For recorded lectures: It would be more preferable if the lecture videos were more up to date and recorded for the current year. Also, when questions from the audience are asked or answers are given, most of the time the sound of them is not high enough for us to follow along and so we can mostly hear only what the professor has to say in response to that question/answer. So, at least for the pre-recorded videos, I would prefer if some text/captions were given for those parts, whenever this is possible.","prerecorded, mic","prerecorded, mic"
"I believe the pre-recorded lectures are nice to have along with the presentation slides. Even if we should switch to all in-person classes from next year, the always-available materials were a big help.",out_of_scope,out_of_scope
"The audio of the lecture videos isn't very good. The slides often contained too much information that was not talked about by the teacher after all, its confusing and I constantly read the background instead of listening.",mic,mic
"The quality of guest lectures varied, I enjoyed the lecture and Q&A by Philip Pattberg a lot!",out_of_scope,out_of_scope
One major issues I had with this course is: the TAs and professor had a different answers to the same question or in some instances (maybe for the better) no answer was provided. I believe some information needs to be ironed out and agreed mutually between the TAs as this makes the assignments 10x harder.,out_of_scope,out_of_scope
"It would have been better if there was a question time during class, and the explanation of the content was more sufficient than the question session.",prerecorded,prerecorded
"the quality of the recordings was quite poor, bad sound. If i have to ask questions 4 days before i have already forgotten my question and the content of the lecture, so maybe bring that deadline closer to the lecture.",prerecorded,prerecorded
The online lectures sadly remove the ability the ask questions immediately (if that is even allowed),prerecorded,prerecorded
The idea of the course is great but it feels like it needs tweaking since it's quiet 'young'. Assignment descriptions are very minimal and prone to errors. Confusion among the teams could be prevented.,out_of_scope,out_of_scope
"There is not a lot of literature about the Decision Maps that we have to make, while it is the most important modelling in the course. For example, when a new technology is introduced a new shape has to be made. In order to learn how to do this we had to ask the TA or had to be corrected. Maybe there should be a video or tutorial on how to make a Decision Map.",out_of_scope,out_of_scope
"It is really easy to just be a ghost in online lectures, also when devided in breakout rooms I expierenced people not talking nor having their cameras on which I find a bit anti-social, I find it more motivating when you have to be somewhere and it pushes me to interact with my fellow students and gives me the feeling I have to do something. But on the other hand the online setting  can be very convenient sometime when you have a lot of other things to do that day by saving time not having to go to the university and back. Therefore I find the trade-off between the pros and cons of in-person and online a bit difficult and if I say in-person is better than online I would be a hypocrit haha, so yeah hybrid is a very nice structure in my opinion but in my observation so far most people go for online especially if there is no group work needed.

"Adjust the assignments for D&S, there were many things that were unclear. Sometimes it seemed that neither the teachers nor the TAs had answers on how questions about the assignment. It was just too many uncertainities regarding the assignment. ",out_of_scope,out_of_scope
