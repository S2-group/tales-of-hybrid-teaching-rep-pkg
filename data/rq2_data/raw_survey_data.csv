So one way to improve that would be something like a student microphone. In my old university, they used to have a cube with a built-in microphone that was very well-protected and could be thrown through the lecture hall in order to shorten the time until a student received the microphone. That worked quite well.
Additionally, I would prefer live lectures we can engage with over the pre-recorded style, which is just very bland and boring to me.",
