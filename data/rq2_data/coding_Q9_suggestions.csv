"Answer the most prominent Q&A questions offline, and rather have Zoom meetings for discussions of the course material, including papers. Instead of answering student questions, ask questions to students. It can be hard online, but it is definitely feasible.
Maybe try to be more creative, instead of Zoom, you could use a more interactive setting. There are success stories of teachers giving lectures inside video games/virtual environments.",swap_qa_lecture,"tech_setting, incentive_inperson, 3d"
"While I personally would rather not have a hybrid system again, I understand why students might prefer it. So one way to improve that would be something like a student microphone. In my old university, they used to have a cube with a built-in microphone that was very well-protected and could be thrown through the lecture hall in order to shorten the time until a student received the microphone. That worked quite well.
Additionally, I would prefer live lectures we can engage with over the pre-recorded style, which is just very bland and boring to me.",microphone,tech_setting

Having the practical on a Tuesday is not the best as it feels like we are always one week behind with work.  Maybe switch the presentations to Tuesdays and have the practicals on Fridays. That way we can also eliminate the need for the 5 minutes session during the first week.,-,"out_of scope, course_structure"

"Re-do the recorded lectures. The spoken content wasn't really in line with the content shown in the slides (especially the first 4 weeks). 
Some sort of live information sharing would be nice apart from the pre recorded lectures, instead of basing the live lectures merely on the Q&A. ","prerecorded, swap_qa_lecture","prerecorded, swap_qa_lecture"

"I think the hybrid part is nice, but the Q&A system is not really. I would have liked it the most if the lectures would not have been pre-recorded but in-person/live. This would enable for live ad hoc questions in stead of submitting questions that are answered a few days later. ",qa,swap_qa_lecture
"Do not pre-record the classes, or make them more appealing. They were often very unmotivated, the teachers also seemed unmotivated. It would be more fun to have an actual  lecture (in-person) or guest lecture, and ask questions during the lecture instead of watching it online and hand in questions digitally",prerecorded,prerecorded
"Instead of having to watch pre-recorded lectures, having an actual lecture during the scheduled sessions is preferred. Also, explain the assignments more in detail during the lecture. It would have been nice if time would have been spent on explaining, for example, how to make a decision map.",prerecorded,prerecorded
